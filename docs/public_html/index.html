    <h1>Career</h1>
    <p>So who is Paul Rodriguez? He is basically your average everyday skateboarder, at least, he used to be that. Son of famous comedian and actor Paul Rodriguez, Paul bought his first skateboard at the age of 12. Paul Rodriguez, also known as “P-Rod” was recognized as a prodigy at the young age of 14, only two years after he started skating. Paul Rodriguez career started rising when he was recruited to the of a local skateboard shop named "one Eighteen". He was 14 years old at the time, but he was shy, so his friend submited his "sponsor me" video. Netkin was impressed so he asked his friend to bring him by the shop. He talked to Paul and soon Paul became sponsored by DNA Skateboards, and  he appeared in the 1999 video Microanalysis. Soon, following girl, Rodriguez joined Plan B skateboard deck brand. That brand is still popular to this day. Later on in 2010, Rodriguez released a solo Plan B video part, entitled Me, Myself, and I. In June 2014, he launched his own skateboard deck company,  went with Primitive Skateboarding, and got his eighth signature shoe with Nike. </p>
    <h2>What is he?</h2>
    <p>He obviously isn't the type of person that gave up. If he was he wouldn't have gotten sponsored or won street league or went to all those competitions. If you completely watch the video down below you'll see how he can skate flatground, but if you go to the Sponsors page watch the vieo, you'll see how skateboarding isn't really what you think it is. He is very creative with the lines that he does, and also he is a very technical skater. His consistency to skateboarding, and his style is what led him to where he is now.</p>
