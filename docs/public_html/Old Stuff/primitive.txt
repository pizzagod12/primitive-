Following Rodriguez's departure from Plan B, he produced a batch of 500 gold-colored skateboard decks for a one-off sale. After the entire batch sold in "two minutes", Rodriguez considered repeating the process on a bi-monthly basis, but he realized that he was in need of an infrastructure to handle the process if it was to occur regularly. Netkin then presented the idea of "Primitive Skateboards" to Rodriguez and the suggestion led to a business meeting—involving all of Rodriguez's other partners in the Primitive brand—in which an agreement to establish the new brand as part of the Primitive business was finalized.[9]

Rodriguez launched his own skateboard brand, Primitive Skateboarding, on April 10, 2014, with the initial team consisting of himself, Nick Tucker and Carlos Ribeiro. Rodriguez explained to the media: "To create my own board brand and have a chance to be a part of skateboarding beyond just being a pro skater is a dream come true."[31] Rodriguez explained in June 2014 that the Primitive Skateboard brand was not conceived as part of a "master plan", but was an idea that emerged in 2012, when he realized that, if he didn't start his own skateboard deck company at the time, the opportunity would never return: "It would’ve been foolish of me to let that opportunity go by and stay in a regular sponsorship." Rodriguez remained with his sponsor at the time, Plan B, for a year before he finalized the decision, as he had experienced success with the brand and was close to all of the people involved.[9]

Tucker was assigned professional status in November 2014, making him the only other Primitive Skateboarding professional other than Rodriguez at the time.[32] Bastien Salabanzi, formerly of Flip Skateboards and Antiz, was recruited as the third Primitive Skateboarding professional on January 5, 2015. Rodriguez introduced Salabanzi on his personal website:

I first met Bastien back at Tampa Pro 2001. I was so amazed at his abilities and how consistent he was. I immediately became inspired to become a better skater and have looked up to him ever since. He is a true legend in skateboarding. I’m honored to have gotten to know him and so excited to have him as a part of the Primitive Skateboarding family![33]
